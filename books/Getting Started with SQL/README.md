# Getting Started with SQL

This book focus on the basics of SQL and how to use SQL to work with data.

## Overview

The first three chapters of the book focus on introducing basic database concepts, such as relationships, tables, centralized and distributed database concepts, and how SQL is used to manipulate data. There will be no notes on these chapters, as they are basic concepts and there is no need for notes.

### Chapter 4: SELECT


This chapter focused on showing how the SELECT command is used. In addition, it showed some tricks, such as the use of aliases or even the generation of new columns in queries. An important point is that the select brings the information, but does not change it. Therefore, if I bring a new column in a select, it will not be persisted in the database.

Since the only command shown was SELECT, there is no need to show the command here. It's possible to find some implementations of this chapter [here]()
